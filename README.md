# Assumptions

1. All logs will be in the format defined at {link}, with the destination port in the 7th spot and the protocol number in the 8th spot
2. All logs will be valid and contain the same number of entries
3. No deprecated protocol numbers will be logged, neither will unassigned protocols or protocols used for testing like 253/254
